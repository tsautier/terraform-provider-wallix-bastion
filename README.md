## Overview

The Terraform Wallix Bastion provider allows you to manage Wallix Bastion resources such as users, groups, authorizations, and more through Infrastructure as Code.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.0
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) `v1.22` or `v1.23` (for development)

### From Terraform Registry

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    wallix-bastion = {
      source  = "wallix/wallix-bastion"
      version = "~> 0.14.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "wallix-bastion" {
  ip          = "your-bastion-host"
  user        = "<user>"
  token       = "<your-api-token>"
}
```

### Local Development Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/wallix/terraform-provider-wallix-bastion.git
cd terraform-provider-wallix-bastion

```bash
# Build and install the provider locally
make install
```

> **Note:** When testing your locally built provider, you may need to explicitly specify the local source and version in your Terraform configuration.
> This ensures Terraform uses your development build instead of the published version.

**Example:**

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    wallix-bastion = {
      source  = "terraform.local/local/wallix-bastion"
      version = "0.0.0-dev"
    }
  }
}
```

## Building the Provider

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Go 1.22 to 1.24
- Make
- Git

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build the provider
make build

# Build for all platforms
make build-all

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### Development Build

```bash
# Install development dependencies
go mod download

# Format code
make fmt

# Run linters
make lint

# Build development version
go build -o terraform-provider-wallix-bastion
```

## Testing

### Running Unit Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run specific test
go test -v ./bastion -run TestAccResourceAuthorization_basic
```

### Running Acceptance Tests

Acceptance tests require a running Wallix Bastion instance.

```bash
# Set environment variables
export WALLIX_BASTION_HOST="your-bastion-host"
export WALLIX_BASTION_USER="admin"
export WALLIX_BASTION_TOKEN="<your-api-token>"
export WALLIX_BASTION_API_VERSION="v3.12"

# Run acceptance tests
make testacc

# Run specific acceptance test
TF_ACC=1 go test -v ./bastion -run TestAccResourceAuthorization_sessionSharing
```

### Test Environment Setup

1. **Set up test environment variables:**

   ```bash
   export WALLIX_BASTION_HOST="your-test-bastion"
   export WALLIX_BASTION_TOKEN="<your-test-token>"
   export WALLIX_BASTION_USER="admin"
   export WALLIX_BASTION_API_VERSION="v3.12"
   export TF_ACC=1
   ```

2. **Create test configuration:**

   ```bash
   # Copy example configuration
   cp examples/authorization_test.tf test.tf

   # Edit with your test values
   vim test.tf
   ```

3. **Run manual tests:**

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   terraform destroy
   ```

## Local Development Workflow

### 1. Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/wallix/terraform-provider-wallix-bastion.git
cd terraform-provider-wallix-bastion

# Install dependencies
go mod download
go mod tidy

# Setup pre-commit hooks (optional)
make setup-dev
```

### 2. Make Changes

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ...

# Format and lint
make fmt
make lint

# Run tests
make test
```

### 3. Test Locally

```bash
# Build and install locally
make install

# Test with your Terraform configuration
cd examples/

# Choose an example directory, e.g., authorization
cd authorization

# Update the provider to use the development build

# terraform {
#   required_version = ">= 1.0"
#   required_providers {
#     wallix-bastion = {
#       # source  = "wallix/wallix-bastion"
#       # version = "0.14.7"
#       source  = "terraform.local/local/wallix-bastion"
#       version = "0.0.0-dev"
#     }
#   }
# }

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### 4. Submit Changes

```bash
# Run full test suite
make test-all

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create pull request
```
