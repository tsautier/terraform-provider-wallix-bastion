resource "wallix-bastion_profile" "user_profile" {
  profile_name = "standard_user"
  description  = "Standard user profile with basic permissions"
  
  gui_features {
    wab_audit      = "view"
    users          = "view"
    devices        = "view"
    authorizations = "view"
  }
  
  gui_transmission {
    users          = "view"
    devices        = "view"
    authorizations = "view"
  }
  
  target_access = true
}

# Administrator profile
resource "wallix-bastion_profile" "admin_profile" {
  profile_name = "administrator"
  description  = "Full administrator profile"
  
  gui_features {
    wab_audit        = "view"
    system_audit     = "view"
    users            = "modify"
    user_groups      = "modify"

## Usage Notes

### GUI Features vs GUI Transmission

- **gui_features**: Controls access to Bastion management features
- **gui_transmission**: Controls access during session transmission/monitoring

### Permission Levels

- **view**: Read-only access
- **modify**: Read and write access
- **execute**: Permission to execute actions (backup, credential recovery)

### Available Features

- **wab_audit**: Bastion audit logs
- **system_audit**: System audit logs
- **users**: User management
- **user_groups**: User group management
- **devices**: Device management
- **target_groups**: Target group management
- **authorizations**: Authorization management
- **profiles**: Profile management
- **wab_settings**: Bastion settings
- **system_settings**: System settings
- **backup**: Backup operations
- **approval**: Approval workflow management
- **credential_recovery**: Credential recovery operations

### Access Control

- **target_access**: Enable/disable access to targets
- **ip_limitation**: Restrict access by IP address/subnet
- **dashboards**: Available dashboard list

### Group Limitations

Restrict profile scope:
- **user_groups_limitation**: Limit which user groups can be managed
- **target_groups_limitation**: Limit which target groups can be accessed

## Import

Profile can be imported using an id made up of `<profile_name>`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import wallix-bastion_profile.admin_profile administrator
```
