## Usage Notes

### Application Categories

- **standard**: For traditional applications with executable paths (default)
- **jumphost**: For web applications accessed through a browser

### Path Configuration

When `category = "standard"`, the `paths` block is required and should specify:
- **target**: The application target (format: `Interactive@device:service`)
- **program**: The full path to the application executable
- **working_dir**: The working directory for the application

### Target Specification

The `target` field should reference:
- A cluster name for clustered targets
- A device name for single device targets

### Global Domains

Use `global_domains` to specify which global domains can access this application.

## Import

Application can be imported using an id made up of `<application_name>`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import wallix-bastion_application.app1 app1
```
