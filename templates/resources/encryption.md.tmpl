## Usage Notes

### Encryption Types

**RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):**
- **Supported Key Sizes**: 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 bits
- **Use Cases**: General-purpose encryption, web services, legacy compatibility
- **Recommendation**: Use 2048 bits minimum, 4096 bits for high security

**DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm):**
- **Supported Key Sizes**: 1024 bits
- **Use Cases**: Digital signatures, legacy system compatibility
- **Note**: Limited to 1024 bits, consider newer algorithms for new deployments

**ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm):**
- **Supported Key Sizes**: 256, 384, 521 bits (corresponding to P-256, P-384, P-521 curves)
- **Use Cases**: Modern applications requiring smaller key sizes with equivalent security
- **Advantages**: Faster operations, smaller keys, equivalent security to larger RSA keys

**Ed25519 (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm):**
- **Key Size**: Fixed (no key_size parameter needed)
- **Use Cases**: Modern applications, high-performance requirements
- **Advantages**: Fast, secure, resistant to timing attacks
- **Recommendation**: Preferred for new deployments

### Security Recommendations

**Algorithm Selection Priority:**
1. **Ed25519**: Best choice for new deployments
2. **ECDSA P-384**: Good balance of security and compatibility
3. **RSA 4096**: For environments requiring RSA
4. **RSA 2048**: Minimum acceptable for RSA
5. **DSA 1024**: Legacy only, avoid for new deployments

### Key Size Guidelines

**RSA Key Sizes:**
- **1024 bits**: Deprecated, not recommended
- **2048 bits**: Minimum acceptable, widely compatible
- **4096 bits**: High security, recommended for sensitive data
- **8192 bits**: Maximum security, may impact performance

**ECDSA Key Sizes:**
- **256 bits (P-256)**: Equivalent to RSA 3072, good for most applications
- **384 bits (P-384)**: Equivalent to RSA 7680, high security
- **521 bits (P-521)**: Maximum security, equivalent to RSA 15360

### Performance Considerations

**Speed Comparison (fastest to slowest):**
1. Ed25519
2. ECDSA
3. RSA (smaller keys faster)
4. DSA

**Resource Usage:**
- **Ed25519**: Minimal CPU and memory usage
- **ECDSA**: Low resource usage, scales well
- **RSA**: Higher resource usage, especially with larger keys
- **DSA**: Moderate resource usage

### Use Case Examples

**Web Application Encryption:**
```terraform
resource "wallix-bastion_encryption" "web_app" {
  type        = "ECDSA"
  key_size    = 256
  description = "Web application encryption"
}
```

**Database Security:**
```terraform
resource "wallix-bastion_encryption" "database" {
  type        = "ECDSA"
  key_size    = 384
  description = "Database connection encryption"
}
```

**Administrative Access:**
```terraform
resource "wallix-bastion_encryption" "admin" {
  type        = "Ed25519"
  description = "Administrative access encryption"
}
```

**Legacy System Support:**
```terraform
resource "wallix-bastion_encryption" "legacy" {
  type        = "RSA"
  key_size    = 2048
  description = "Legacy system compatibility"
}
```

### Compliance Considerations

**FIPS 140-2 Compliance:**
- Use RSA 2048+ or ECDSA P-256+
- Avoid DSA for new implementations

**Common Criteria:**
- ECDSA P-384 or RSA 4096 recommended
- Ed25519 may require specific validation

**Industry Standards:**
- **Banking**: Often requires RSA 2048+ or ECDSA P-256+
- **Government**: May mandate specific algorithms and key sizes
- **Healthcare**: HIPAA compliance often satisfied with RSA 2048+ or ECDSA

### Migration Strategies

**Upgrading from Legacy:**
```terraform
# Current legacy encryption
resource "wallix-bastion_encryption" "legacy" {
  type        = "RSA"
  key_size    = 1024
  description = "Legacy RSA encryption (to be replaced)"
}

# New modern encryption
resource "wallix-bastion_encryption" "modern" {
  type        = "Ed25519"
  description = "Modern Ed25519 encryption"
}
```

### Integration with Other Resources

Encryption configurations can be referenced by:
- SSH key generation
- Certificate authorities
- Connection policies
- Authentication domains

### Monitoring and Maintenance

**Key Rotation:**
- Plan regular key rotation schedules
- Monitor key age and usage
- Implement automated rotation where possible

**Security Monitoring:**
- Monitor for deprecated algorithms
- Track key usage patterns
- Alert on weak encryption usage

### Troubleshooting

**Compatibility Issues:**
1. Check client/server algorithm support
2. Verify key size requirements
3. Test with legacy systems
4. Review protocol specifications

**Performance Issues:**
1. Monitor CPU usage during encryption operations
2. Consider key size vs. performance trade-offs
3. Test with expected load patterns
4. Optimize based on use case requirements

## Import

Encryption configuration can be imported using the encryption id, e.g.

```shell
terraform import wallix-bastion_encryption.rsa_2048 xxxxxxxx
```
