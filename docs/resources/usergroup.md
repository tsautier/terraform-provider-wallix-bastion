  timeframes = ["business_hours"]
  profile = "user"
  
  users = [

    "bob",
    "charlie"
  ]
}

# Configure user group with restrictions

## Schema

### Required

- `group_name` (String)
- `timeframes` (Set of String)

### Optional

- `description` (String)
- `profile` (String)
- `restrictions` (Block Set) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--restrictions))
- `users` (Set of String)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--restrictions"></a>

### Nested Schema for `restrictions`

Required:

- `action` (String)
- `rules` (String)
- `subprotocol` (String)

## Usage Notes

### Timeframes

User groups must be associated with timeframes that define when access is allowed:

- Use existing timeframe names (e.g., "allthetime", "business_hours")
- Create custom timeframes with `wallix-bastion_timeframe` resource
- Multiple timeframes can be specified for flexible access control

### Profiles

Assign appropriate profiles to control GUI and API access:

- **user**: Standard user profile with limited administrative access
- **admin**: Administrative profile with full system access
- Custom profiles created with `wallix-bastion_profile` resource

### User Management

The `users` attribute is read-only when not set, showing current group membership.
When specified, it controls which users belong to this group.

### Restrictions

Apply command restrictions to limit user actions:

- **action**: "kill" terminates sessions, "notify" sends alerts
- **rules**: Regular expression to match restricted commands
- **subprotocol**: Protocol to monitor (SSH_SHELL_SESSION, RDP, SFTP_SESSION, etc.)

### Available Subprotocols

- **SSH**: SSH_SHELL_SESSION, SSH_REMOTE_COMMAND, SSH_SCP_UP, SSH_SCP_DOWN
- **SFTP**: SFTP_SESSION
- **RDP**: RDP (covers all RDP operations)
- **Others**: RLOGIN, TELNET

## Import

Usergroup can be imported using an id made up of `<group_name>`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import wallix-bastion_usergroup.developers developers
```
